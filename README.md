# My Personal Project

## Task 1 
A workout routine organizer. 

## Task 2
My project will be an application which tracks fitness progress and stores past workouts. 
This can include weight lifting, calisthenics skills, swimming and any sports activities. 
An example of a function that this application will have is being able to have accurate statistics
(ex. most weight lifting in a single session) that summarize a user's fitness journey. 
The project will have multiple classes which represent the different activties. These classes will 
have fields which keep track of valuable information (ex. repetitions, sets, personal records, etc.).

Since 2023 just ended, I believe many people are interested in becoming a better version of themselves
through improving their confidence and athleticism. This will keep track of their progress while 
organizing their personal goals and records. This project interests me due to my passion for trying 
out new skills and learning. I have been weight lifting since the start of school year and have been 
trying to get better at swimming to improve my cardio. There are many applications which track workouts 
and goals, but I believe that staying organized also means using tools which are made **specifically for 
a person**. My goal is to create a program which can be used by a wider range of people, but still simple
enough to personalize.
